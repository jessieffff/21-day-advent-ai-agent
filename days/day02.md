# Day 2 – LangChain Primer: Models, Prompts, Chains

_Timebox: ~1 hour_

## Knowledge goals

- Understand LangChain’s core concepts: models, prompts, chains
- Learn how to structure a basic chain and prompt
- Run your first LLM call using LangChain

## Learning materials (≈ 20–25 minutes)

- Read: [**LangChain — Quickstart**](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/quickstart) (intro to models, prompts, chains)
- Read: [**LangChain — Models documentation**](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/models)
- Read: [**LangChain — Prompts documentation**](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/modules/prompts)
- Read: [**LangChain — Chains documentation**](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains)
- Optional: [**LangChain Cookbook**](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)

## Activities (about 30 minutes)

- Write a one-paragraph summary of LangChain’s core concepts (models, prompts, chains)
- Sketch a diagram showing how a prompt flows through a model and chain
- Run a simple LLM call using LangChain (e.g., generate a summary or answer a question)
- Create a backlog: note LangChain skills to emphasize (e.g., prompt engineering, chaining, error handling)
- Capture notes in `notes/day02_notes.md` (or your journal) for future reference.

## Knowledge check

- In your words: what is a LangChain chain and why use it?
- Describe the flow from prompt to model to chain output
- Give one example of a simple chain and one of a more complex chain
