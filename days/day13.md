# Day 13 – Memory in AI agents

_Timebox: ~1 hour_

## Knowledge goals

- Understand what memory means for AI agents and how it differs from simple context windows.
- Learn the three fundamental pillars: state, persistence, and selection.
- Distinguish between session-local context and persistent, structured memory across interactions.

## Learning materials (≈ 20–25 minutes)

- Read: [**Memory in Agents: What, Why and How**](https://mem0.ai/blog/memory-in-agents-what-why-and-how?utm_source=chatgpt.com) (primary article covering the three pillars of agent memory: state, persistence, and selection)
- Read: [**LangChain memory guide**](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/use-cases/chatbots/memory) (basic patterns for short- and long-term memory in LLM applications)
- Optional: [**IBM overview of long-term memory**](https://www.ibm.com/topics/long-term-memory) (context and use cases for persistent memory in agents)
- Optional: [**Mem0 documentation**](https://docs.mem0.ai/) (how a memory layer for AI agents is implemented in practice)

## Activities (about 30 minutes)

- Draft your own one-paragraph definition of what memory means for an AI agent.
- Create a comparison table or diagram showing context window vs. persistent memory (duration, scaling, continuity, objective).
- Review an agent prototype you've worked on (or design a hypothetical one) and identify: what information would be valuable to store in memory, and how you'd decide what gets retained vs. discarded.
- List 3 use cases where memory enables personalization or long-term planning.
- Capture notes in `notes/day13_notes.md` (or your journal) so you can revisit later.

## Knowledge check

- In your words: what is memory in AI agents and why does it matter?
- Explain the difference between a context window and persistent memory.
- Describe the three pillars of agent memory: state, persistence, and selection.
- Give one example where persistent memory would significantly improve an agent's performance over session-only context.
