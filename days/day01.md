# Day 1 – AI foundations & agent basics

_Timebox: ~1 hour_

## Knowledge goals

- Distinguish agents from chatbots and simple chains; understand when to use an agent.
- Learn the core perceive–decide–act loop and how tools fit into it.
- Get a light taxonomy of agent patterns (reactive, plan-and-execute, multi-agent handoff).

## Learning materials (pick ~20–25 minutes)

- Read: LangChain docs – [“What is an agent?”](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/agents) and [“How agents use tools.”](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tools)
- Skim: OpenAI “Building agents” intro for the perceive–decide–act loop.
- Optional: A short blog post on agent vs. chain vs. RAG to see positioning.

## Activities (about 30 minutes)

- Draft your own one-paragraph definition of an AI agent vs. chatbot vs. chain.
- Sketch the perceive–decide–act loop and annotate where tools are called.
- List 3–5 real tasks where an agent is useful and 3 where a simple chain/RAG is enough.
- Create a small backlog for this journey: note skills you want to emphasize (e.g., tool use, evaluation, deployment).
- Capture notes in `notes/day01_notes.md` (or your journal) so you can revisit later.

## Knowledge check

- In your words: why use an agent instead of a plain chat or RAG chain?
- Describe the perceive–decide–act loop and how tool calls fit in.
- Give one example each: a task suited for a reactive agent, and a task better handled by plan-and-execute.
